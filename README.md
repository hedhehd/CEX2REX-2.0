Install Testkit Firmware on Retail consoles. 99% chance that it will NOT brick your vita unless you exit the app or shut down the system while flashing or anything and make sure its fully charged.

WARNING:THIS WILL MAKE YOUR VITA TO REX, IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, THERES NO RECOVERY (Not even with an hardware flasher), SO MAKE SURE TO NOT TOUCH THE VITA AND FULLY CHARGE IT.



CEX2REX 2.0

How to use:
1) Download the Testkit/DEX PUP file for your firmware and put it @ ux0:/DEX.PUP
2) Run the app and press X to install
- its recommended to have reF00D (https://github.com/dots-tb/reF00D) installed, as f00d refuses to decrypt some testkit applications

Testkit Features that DO work

Thats all for debug settings (there is alot)

SceShell

No PS Store icon by default (still able to get with "Enable PS Store" app https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/enablepsstore)
No stupid "Tips" on reset telling you how to use the system for the 300th time
No advertisements on the game selector screen.
Show mode can be accessed (L + R + RIGHT on DPAD + START)
Debug Utility added to game options menu
More information shown on the Information Screen
No longer checks AID or FW in id.dat (effectively, no memory card lock :D)
"Debug Utility"
On the edit livearea bubbles screen, if you tap on a icon
theres a new entry called "Debug Utility",
Inside that you have the following options:
- Check (Runs the checker utility, might need reF00D to run properly. due to real F00D being a bitch)
- Delete SaveData (Deletes savedata for the active user)
- Delete ALL SaveData (Deletes savedata for all users)
- Delete Patch (Deletes the Patch aka "Title Update" data)
- Delete Addcont (Delete AddOn data (DLCs and such)
- Generate Core File (Generates a coredump, same as if the game crashes.)

"Show Mode"

which locks the ps and power button,
they acturaly still work if you press and hold them for long enough lol.
This probably intended for use at conventions and other places with game demos..
Key Combo (L + R + RIGHT on DPAD + START)

"Information" screen

When you view a games information on the LiveArea:
- Title ID
- PS Vita Card RW Area (grw0 size)
- Upgradable App (using trail/full modes)
- Save Data Account
- Save Data Quota (max savefile size)

Browser app

No "Playstation.com" icon on the LiveArea
Settings "Security" tab removed, infact trend micro is just removed
"Title Stores"
Most likely used by offical devs to see what there game would look like on the store..
It is possible to access the download list from here

Devkit CMA

Content Mannager Assistant has the option to "Copy SaveData Only"
also, the accountid used in CMA will allways be 0x000000000000000
which acturally means you can copy backups made on DEX to any other DEX console :D

Checker

Needs reF00D by dots_tb to run properly. since f00d refuses to decrypt it..
Checks a game to make sure it matches with Sony's TRC requirements (required for publishing to PSN)

MiniSettings For QA

A settings app that only has debug settings in it.. idk why its there either

Quick Sign Up

Needs reF00D by dots_tb to run properly. since f00d refuses to decrypt it..
Quickly sign up to playstation network, (sp-int only?, or maybe CID?)

Testkit firmwares that dont work ~

System update

Cannot install testkit update .PUP files.
only retail ones still.

Safe Mode

The testkit spoofer (testkit.skprx) doesnt run in safe mode.
the testkit safemode is slightly different though,
i think it has extra options under "Update System Software"?

Downgrading

Real testkits can downgrade to any other testkit firmware they want, with littearlly no restriction
though sony can (and has in the past) blocked you from downgrading past a certain point
Modoru pretty much offers this functionality anyway though.

Untested features

USB Ethernet
Ive often wondered if on REX you could use the "USB Ethernet Adapter" for testkits.
it should work. but there incredibly hard to come by, so i havent been able to try it ..
